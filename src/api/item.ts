      agendaItemSummary:
        '<p><em>Culture Connects: An Action Plan for Culture in Toronto (2025-2035)</em> sets an ambitious 10-year vision for Toronto as a city for culture and creativity, where everyone, everywhere, can discover, experience, and create culture. This vision positions Toronto as an undeniable global cultural capital, celebrated for its exciting and expansive cultural and creative industry offerings as well as its accomplished talent. Culture is engrained in this city, making Toronto a better place to live, work, and visit. It drives economic growth, strengthens community bonds, and promotes social well-being, helping to create thriving, healthy communities.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It has been over a decade since the City&rsquo;s last culture plan, Creative Capital Gains, was introduced in 2011. Since then, there have been significant economic, cultural, and societal shifts &ndash; and a devastating global pandemic. Emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, Toronto&rsquo;s culture sector is at an inflection point and faces great instability. Challenges include access to space, affordability, equity, changing audience habits, and sponsor supports. As emphasized in public consultations, the Action Plan also has a significant focus on ensuring culture becomes more available to people across the city, wherever they live, close to their homes, and embedded in their communities. A new Action Plan is needed to address the current obstacles and seize the opportunities of the next 10 years. Inaction would threaten Toronto&rsquo;s vibrancy, liveability, and prosperity. Now is the moment to invest in culture, chart a forward path, and reinforce and reimagine culture in Toronto.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Culture Connects: An Action Plan for Culture in Toronto (2025-2035)</em>, included as Attachment 1, has been shaped and guided by community input. The Action Plan includes 28 actions grouped into four priority areas: 1) Culture Everywhere; 2) Culture for All; 3) Culture for the Future; and 4) Culture Beyond our Borders. These priorities are based on input shared by more than 4,000 residents throughout the Action Plan&rsquo;s community engagement process, comprehensive research conducted by the University of Toronto, and best practices from leading cities from around the world.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This report outlines the need for an action plan, detailing the engagement process and key results as well as the Action Plan&rsquo;s vision, priorities, and core components. This includes the Year One focus, the framework for ongoing engagement, and accountability measures, such as regular progress reporting.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Action Plan includes both urgent actions to immediately address critical challenges, and long-term actions to drive systemic change. The urgent need to invest and connect will be the focus of Year One of the Action Plan, including increased support for the Toronto Arts Council; funds to support stabilization and transformation for cultural organizations; and hosting the inaugural Mayor&rsquo;s Culture Summit. Throughout its implementation, the Action Plan will focus on impacts and outcomes, continued engagement, transparency, and accountability. With Culture Connects, the City presents a bold strategy to transform current realities and seize opportunities to create a vibrant and prosperous future for culture in Toronto.</p>',

        'Sidewalks to Skylines: An Action Plan for Toronto’s Economy (2025-2035)',
      agendaItemSummary:
        "<p>It has been over a decade since the launch of Collaborating for Competitiveness, the City of Toronto&rsquo;s last plan to advance economic development, with a focus on job creation and economic growth. Since then, new trends, challenges, and opportunities have emerged both at the global and the local level, reshaping the city's and regional industry competitiveness, supply chains, workforce dynamics and land use pressures. Given its fundamental strengths, Toronto is well positioned to face these challenges and leverage opportunities toward an economy that is competitive, inclusive, and advancing towards net zero emissions. Achieving this vision, however, will require a long-term plan with impactful actions, dedicated resources, and intentional and collaborative coordination with partners. Before aspirational targets for inclusive and sustainable economic growth can be met, the integrity of basic City services and the foundation they create for economic growth must first be addressed. This Action Plan sets out a vision to both get the basics right and set an aspirational agenda to drive Toronto's economy forward, confronting its challenges and leveraging its many strengths.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Guided by this bold vision, Sidewalks to Skylines - an Action Plan for Toronto's Economy (2025-2035) provides a roadmap for the City to strategically maximize its levers and collaborate with its partners to enhance Toronto's economy with a focus on livability, inclusivity, and prosperity in the next ten years. The Action Plan is the result of robust research and analysis of best practices in other jurisdictions, as well as extensive engagement and consultation with over 1,000 stakeholders, including business leaders, academics, small businesses, business associations, major employers, institutions, community coalitions, labour unions, and residents. It identifies three priorities: Strong Main Streets, Quality Jobs, and Global Competitiveness. These priorities are anchored by a foundational priority, Getting the Basics Right, which focuses on key City levers to improve quality of life and enable a business environment that optimizes conditions to achieve broader economic ambitions and facilitate economic prosperity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The success of the Action Plan will be dependent on effective partnerships; it will also depend on the access to resources and revenues commensurate with the City's responsibilities as a municipal government to support Toronto's role as Canada's leading global centre for commerce, creativity, and capital. To guide these efforts, in addition to a five-year work plan, the Action Plan highlights 29 leading actions, including 10 to strengthen the foundation and 19 to advance the priorities to drive meaningful change. To monitor the progress of the Action Plan, each of the 29 leading actions is accompanied by one or more success indicators. Progress will be reported to City Council on an annual basis.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In 2030, informed by the success of and lessons learned from the first five years, a new five-year work plan responsive to the economic context of the time will be presented for consideration by City Council. Through the implementation of the Action Plan, the City will help advance liveability, inclusion, and shared prosperity beyond the traditional measure of economic growth in partnership with other organizations and for all communities across Toronto.</p>",

      agendaItemSummary:
        '<p>The purpose of this report is to provide an update on outstanding directives related to the Noise By-law, including options to reduce noise from waste collection, a recommendation to provide a noise exemption permit application fee waiver for grassroots cultural organizations, and an assessment of amplified sound levels that exceed ambient levels. This report also provides an update on the status of implementation of amendments made to the Noise By-law in June and September 2024, including ongoing efforts to respond to motor vehicle noise.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Per direction from Council to explore options to reduce noise from waste collection, staff recommend keeping the waste collection noise exemption in place, given limited data available on waste collection noise sources, locations and timing, and the benefits of mitigating waste buildup, odour, safety issues, and congestion by allowing collection during non-peak hours. To address noise disturbances from waste collection, staff recommend implementing programmatic changes to aid in identifying and reducing specific sources of waste collection noise on a case-by-case basis, by working with industry to address noise reports and developing noise mitigation guidelines. MLS will monitor how private collectors respond to waste collection noise reports, and escalate cases where issues are not resolved to community mediation. This process will be monitored until the end of 2025, at which time further recommendations can be considered if the process is not effective at reducing noise reports.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Council also directed staff to explore the feasibility of waiving the noise exemption permit application fee for grassroots cultural organizations, which staff are recommending as part of this report.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This report was prepared in consultation with Economic Development and Culture and Solid Waste Management Services.</p>',

      agendaItemTitle: 'Updating the City’s Coyote Strategy',
      agendaItemSummary:
        '<p>On or about the July 1, 2024 Canada Day Long Weekend, a number of residents and media reports brought attention to three or four physical attacks by a group of coyotes on dogs which were being walked by local dog owners. Videos were published documenting some of the attacks, and there were reports of injuries to the dogs, and injuries sustained by one dog owner connected with the attack. These incidents were linked to Princess Margaret Park, a city park in Etobicoke Centre with a wooded area, open space and a playground. For many weeks following, residents reported and documented encounters with multiple coyotes in the surrounding neighbourhood and public spaces. These included incidents of coyotes approaching dogs.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Toronto Animal Services promptly investigated the attacks and canvassed the local neighbourhood. It was discovered that a family of coyotes had suddenly relocated to Princess Margaret Park from another larger ravine valley park nearby. Several theories exist why the family relocated, however it became clear that there was a family with a mother, father, a juvenile, and three to four yearling coyotes. In addition, there were a litter of pups in a den within the park bringing the total number to approximately twelve at the time.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A well attended public meeting was held on August 1, 2024 with community members, Toronto Animal Services, Coyote Watch Canada, and the local Councillor. At the meeting there were presentations, questions and answers, public comments and information exchange. Several residents expressed concerns about public safety and asked that the City euthanize the coyotes immediately. A petition exists requesting similar action. In addition, some circulating inaccurate information was identified about trapping, capturing or attempting to relocate animals which has caused confusion or distorted the situation and expectations of the public.<br /> &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As demonstrated by the discourse of the meeting, ambiguity exists about the role of the municipality in addressing wildlife such as coyotes, the legal and regulatory context, the threshold of what constitutes a threat to public safety, and about how to report information about coyote encounters to the Toronto Animal Services. Expectations of the City and opinions on the Coyotes varied, due in part to the difficulty of easily accessing factual information and a clear policy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The City of Toronto has a Coyote Strategy first approved in 2003. It was considered again in 2004 to provide certain exemptions for the use of firearms in managing coyotes. The strategy was reviewed again in 2013. The decision is located here: <a href="https://secure.toronto.ca/council/agenda-item.do?item=2013.LS23.3">https://secure.toronto.ca/council/agenda-item.do?item=2013.LS23.3</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Several municipalities have recently updated their coyote strategies and public facing communications to assist residents with contextual information about urban wildlife encounters, and clarity about the role of the municipality in escalating classifications of incidents to ensure that there is an appropriate response and data collection. Some examples include Vaughan, Oakville, and Collingwood.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of the recommended motion is twofold; to request a review and update to the City&rsquo;s coyote strategy based on the newest best practices, and to seek opportunities to improve the capture of reports and information about coyotes from the public to better respond and monitor coyotes in the city.</p>',
      agendaItemRecommendation:
        '<p>Councillor Stephen Holyday recommends that the Economic and Community Development Committee:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1.

Request that Toronto Animal Services, in consultation the Customer Experience Division and 311, review and consider enhancements to the contact intake process and available public information on coyotes, based on best practices of other municipalities and on the data-gathering necessities of the City to monitor and respond to coyote encounters.</p>',

      agendaItemSummary:
        '<p>The purpose of this report is to recommend removing 6 Leslie Street from Interim Control By-law 979-2017 (the "ICBL").&nbsp; By removing this site from the ICBL, the zoning for this site in Zoning By-law 438-86 will apply, permitting light industrial uses on site. The Port Lands Official Plan Amendment identified 6 Leslie Street is a future planned park with permitted interim uses, including light industrial uses that support production, interactive and creative industries ("PIC Core uses"). This is a city initiated zoning change.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The ICBL was adopted in 2017 and extended in 2018, to provide sufficient time for a zoning review to be completed for Port Lands employment-focused lands. The objective of this zoning review was to ensure consistency between the City Council-adopted Port Lands Area Specific Policy and implementing zoning. The four resulting zoning by-laws were adopted by Council in 2019 but were appealed to the Ontario Land Tribunal and remain unresolved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The site is owned by Toronto Port Lands Company and managed by CreateTO. The site is planned for a future extension of the adjacent Leslie Lookout Park. There are two existing vacant one-storey buildings on the site that have been used as a production and broadcasting facility in the past and, most recently, have been used as flex studio space.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Economic Development and Culture has identified 6 Leslie Street as a candidate for the "Music Rehearsal Spaces in the City of Toronto" pilot program, which was adopted by City Council on February 2, 2022. This pilot program would create an inventory of City-owned properties suitable for lease to rehearsal studio and production space operators at below-market rates.</p>',

      agendaItemSummary:
        "<p>This application proposes to amend Zoning By-law 569-2013 for the lands municipally known as 985 Woodbine Avenue and 2078, 2086, 2100, 2102 and 2106 Danforth Avenue to permit a mixed-use development with a 10-storey residential building in the north-easterly portion of the site and a 35-storey tower in the south-westerly portion of the site, connected by non-residential uses in a shared base building. The site is immediately adjacent to the Woodbine TTC station.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The proposed development includes 45,766 square metres of Gross Floor Area, of which 3,492 square metres are allocated to non-residential uses. The proposed non-residential uses include a grocery store and theatre space in the west building and daycare space in the east building. The application also proposes a total of 606 residential units, including 14 rental replacement units and 12 affordable rental units. One level of underground parking will serve both buildings.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The proposed development is consistent with the Provincial Policy Statement (2020) and the Provincial Planning Statement (2024). It conforms with A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (2020). The proposed development also conforms to the City's Official Plan, including Site and Area Specific Policy 552 implementing Segment 1 of the Danforth Planning Study from Coxwell Avenue to Victoria Park Avenue.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This report reviews and recommends approval of the application to amend the Zoning By-law. The proposed mixed-use buildings fit with the existing and planned context of the surrounding area. The mix of residential unit types including affordable rental units, as well as the proposed daycare space, theatre space and commercial component, assists in the creation of complete communities by providing mixed-use intensification around a transit station.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This report also reviews and recommends approval of the Rental Housing Demolition application. The proposal includes full replacement of the existing 14 rental dwelling units, and a Tenant Relocation and Assistance Plan that addresses the right for existing tenants to return to replacement rental dwelling units at similar rents and financial assistance to mitigate hardship.</p>",

The application includes the conveyance of 207 and 209 Avenue Road (an area of approximately 365 square metres) as off-site parkland dedication, which will result in the expansion of Ramsden Park and an increase to the park frontage on Avenue Road.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parkland conveyance is to be delivered as a combination of the applicant&rsquo;s Section 42 parkland dedication requirement and a Community Benefits Charge (&ldquo;CBC&rdquo;) in-kind contribution.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>City Council directed City Planning staff to report back on the value of the CBC in-kind contribution. The purpose of this report is to inform City Council that the acquisition of the off-site parkland requires 63% of the value of the in-kind CBC contribution in conjunction with the Section 42 contribution for the above-noted development.</p>',

      agendaItemSummary:
        '<p>This report recommends that City Council refuse an application under Section 34(1)2 of the Ontario Heritage Act (the "OHA") to demolish the pair of cottages at 40-44 Mitchell Avenue, which are designated under Part IV of the OHA.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Located on the north side of Mitchell Avenue, the subject properties contain a pair of single-storey semi-detached workers\' cottages that are rare, early surviving examples of this typology in Toronto. They are one of the last remaining pairs of the original sixteen pairs of workers\' cottages completed in 1858 by James Lukin Robinson on the former Military lands east of Garrison Creek. Collectively and known historically as the Robinson Cottages or Garrison Common Cottages, only six pairs remain, located at 40-44 and 71-75 Mitchell Avenue and 703-705, 719-721, 735-737 and 753-755 Richmond Street West.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Among the first residential buildings constructed in the area, they are important reminders of the origins of the Niagara Street neighbourhood, where they define, support and maintain the historical character. The semi-detached houses feature the near-square plans, low hipped roofs and symmetrical placement of the door and window openings inspired by the bungalow that originated in India, which influenced the early-19th century Regency Cottage and, on a more modest scale, the vernacular workers\' cottage.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>An application under Section 34(1)2 of the Act has been submitted to demolish the pair of cottages at 40-44 Mitchell Avenue to allow for the construction of two new three-storey residential buildings. Consent and minor variance applications B0026/21TEY, A0272/21TEY and A0273/21TEY were submitted for the proposal in 2021. The consent application is currently under appeal at the Toronto Local Appeal Body (the "TLAB"), and the hearing for the minor variance applications were deferred by the Committee of Adjustment. A TLAB hearing date has not been set as it is anticipated that revised plans and minor variances will be submitted shortly, which may also be the subject of appeals and would be consolidated with the consent appeal. This report does not deal with planning matters. It relates solely to the requirements under the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>',

If the owner appeals City Council&rsquo;s decision to refuse the issuance of a demolition permit under Section 34(1)2 of the Ontario Heritage Act for the heritage properties at 40-44 Mitchell Avenue, City Council authorize the City Solicitor and the necessary City staff to attend the Ontario Land Tribunal hearing in opposition to the appeal.</p>',

The applicant indicates the reason for requesting removal of the tree is due to concerns that falling branches may damage the roof; the trunk may cause damage to the property line fence; and the tree is growing in restricted soil volume which may limit the tree&rsquo;s growth and negatively impact its health.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The European beech tree (Fagus sylvatica fastigiata) measures 34 cm in diameter. The City's Tree By-laws do not support the removal of this tree as it is healthy and maintainable. The permit was denied, and the applicant is appealing the decision.

The existing Fairview Mall will be retained. The proposed development is intended to occur in a long-term phased manner and is intended to accommodate a planned population of approximately 12000 people and 800 jobs in Blocks A and B.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The draft Official Plan Amendment is consistent with the Provincial Policy Statement (2020) and the Provincial Planning Statement (2024), and conforms with A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (2020). The draft Official Plan Amendment is also consistent with the intent of the City's Official Plan, including the Sheppard East Subway Corridor Secondary Plan.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This report reviews and recommends approval of the Official Plan Amendment attached to this report.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A separate Zoning By-law Amendment was also submitted with the original Official Plan Amendment application. This Zoning By-law Amendment application applied specifically to lands that are referred to as Phase 1 (shown on Attachment 7) of the overall development site.&nbsp; This Zoning By-law Amendment application is not being advanced at this time and will be addressed through a separate report to Council in the future.</p>",
      agendaItemRecommendation:
        "<p>The Director, Community Planning North York District recommends that:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1.

City Council accept the on-site parkland dedication, subject to the owner transferring the parkland to the City free and clear, above and below grade, of all easements, encumbrances, and encroachments, in an acceptable environmental condition; the owner may propose the exception of encumbrances of tiebacks, where such an encumbrance is deemed acceptable by the General Manager, Parks, Forestry and Recreation, in consultation with the City Solicitor; and such an encumbrance will be subject to the payment of compensation to the City, in an amount as determined by the General Manager, Parks, Forestry and Recreation and the Executive Director, Corporate Real Estate Management.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>6. City Council approve a development charge credit against the Parks and Recreation component of the Development Charges for the design and construction by the Owner of the Above Base Park Improvements to the satisfaction of the General Manager, Parks, Forestry and Recreation.

City Council direct the City Clerk, should an appeal be filed, to notify all persons or public bodies who may have filed an appeal to this decision of City Council&rsquo;s intention to rely on subsections 22(8.1) and 34(11.0.0.1) of the Planning Act and the City Clerk shall provide notice to all prescribed persons or public bodies under subsections 22(8.2) and 34(11.0.0.2) of the Planning Act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>4. City Council direct the City Clerk, should an appeal be filed, to notify the Ontario Land Tribunal of City Council&rsquo;s intention pursuant to subsections 22(8.1) and 34(11.0.0.1) of the Planning Act, and that the Ontario Land Tribunal shall receive the record, the notice of appeal and other prescribed documents and materials seventy-five (75) days after the last day for filing a notice of appeal for these matters.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>5. Should the Official Plan Amendment and Zoning By-law Amendment applications be resolved, and there is no appeal to the Ontario Land Tribunal or the appeal to the Ontario Land Tribunal has been withdrawn, City Council direct the Director North District, Community Planning to bring forward an Approval Report to North York Community Council for a statutory public meeting as required under the Planning Act.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>6.

Meetings were convened with the Fairness Monitor to address the impacts of the MZO and a revised financial package based on a long-term land lease to reflect a change in City priorities concerning land sales. Following discussions with the Fairness Monitor, an Addendum to the RFP, supported with supplementary reports, and documents were prepared and reviewed by the Fairness Monitor.
